# Plan Phase

## Purpose

Research, brainstorm, and produce a written plan before any code is written. The plan becomes the source of truth for the Work phase.

## Inputs

- A task description or goal from the user
- Access to the project codebase
- Optionally, existing docs in `docs/structure/` and `docs/solutions/`

## Agents Available

Before running each agent, present it and wait for user approval:

```
Next agent: [agent-name]
Reason: [Why this agent is relevant to the current task]

Run this agent? (yes / skip / stop)
```

| Agent | When to use | Path |
|-------|------------|------|
| `repo-research-analyst` | Unfamiliar with the codebase or area being modified | `agents/repo-research-analyst.md` |
| `best-practices-researcher` | Need external patterns, examples, or prior art | `agents/best-practices-researcher.md` |
| `framework-docs-researcher` | Working with a framework/library — need official docs or source exploration | `agents/framework-docs-researcher.md` |
| `spec-flow-analyzer` | Need to map user flows, identify spec gaps, or trace data through the system | `agents/spec-flow-analyzer.md` |

### Skills

| Skill | When to use | Path |
|-------|------------|------|
| `brainstorming` | Open-ended problem that benefits from exploring multiple approaches | `skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md` |

Not every agent runs every time. Select based on what the task needs.

## Confirmation Gate

Before each agent invocation, present the agent name and a one-line reason. Wait for the user to approve (yes), skip, or stop the phase entirely.

## Output

A plan file saved to `docs/plans/` in the consuming project. The plan should include:
- Clear goal statement
- Step-by-step implementation approach
- Files to create or modify
- Acceptance criteria
- Any open questions or risks

## Next Phase

**Work** (`02_work/PHASE.md`) — Execute the plan.
