# Work Phase

## Purpose

Execute a plan from the Plan phase. Write code and tests following the plan's steps exactly, without freestyling or adding unplanned features.

## Inputs

- A completed plan in `docs/plans/`
- Access to the project codebase

## Agents Available

Before running each agent, present it and wait for user approval:

```
Next agent: [agent-name]
Reason: [Why this agent is relevant]

Run this agent? (yes / skip / stop)
```

| Agent | When to use | Path |
|-------|------------|------|
| `implementation-executor` | A plan exists and needs to be implemented step by step | `agents/implementation-executor.md` |
| `test-writer` | Implementation is complete and needs test coverage | `agents/test-writer.md` |

Typical flow: run `implementation-executor` first, then `test-writer`.

## Confirmation Gate

Before each agent invocation, present the agent name and a one-line reason. Wait for the user to approve (yes), skip, or stop the phase entirely.

## Output

- Implemented code following the plan
- Tests covering the implementation
- Updated plan file with completed steps checked off

## Next Phase

**Review** (`03_review/PHASE.md`) — Validate the implementation.
