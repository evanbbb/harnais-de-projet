## Overview

**Plan → Work → Review → Compound → Repeat**

### Agents vs Skills

- **Agents** are autonomous prompts for the Task tool. They research, analyze, or validate independently given a goal.
- **Skills** are step-by-step processes with supporting assets (templates, schemas, references). They guide Claude through structured workflows with decision points.
