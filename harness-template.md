## Harness

This project uses harnais_de_projet for its agent workflow.
Harness location: docs/harness (local copy)

### How to use
- Full workflow: Read docs/harness/orchestrator.md
- Single phase: Read the phase entry point for the phase you need:
  - Plan: docs/harness/01_plan/PLAN_PHASE.md
  - Work: docs/harness/02_work/WORK_PHASE.md
  - Review: docs/harness/03_review/REVIEW_PHASE.md
  - Compound: docs/harness/04_compound/COMPUND_PHASE.md
- Specific agent: Read docs/harness/{phase}/agents/{name}.md (e.g. docs/harness/01_plan/agents/best-practices-researcher.md)

### Phases
- `01_plan` — Research, brainstorm, produce a plan
- `02_work` — Execute the plan, write code and tests
- `03_review` — Validate quality, catch issues
- `04_compound` — Document solutions for future reference

### On session start

1. **Check for harness updates**: If docs/harness/AGENT_SKILL_DIRECTORY.md exists, read it and compare the `Harness version` at the top against the `last_seen_version` below. If the harness version is newer, tell the user: "Harness updated to version [X]. Read AGENT_SKILL_DIRECTORY.md for what's available." Then update `last_seen_version` here to match.

2. If the user hasn't given a specific task, read `docs/to-do.md` and suggest the highest-priority item that isn't already in progress. Present it as a suggestion, not an action — wait for the user to confirm before starting work.

last_seen_version: 1.0
